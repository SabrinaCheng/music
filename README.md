# Beat & Tempo

## Introduction
How to create a playlist for better workout?
"Listening to music during exercise can improve results, both in terms of being a motivator (people exercise longer and more vigorously to music) and as a distraction from negatives like fatigue." "Music tempo with high motivational qualities roughly corresponds to the average person's heart rate during a routine workout." Taking the advantagies of new opportunities that wearable devices enables heart rate monitoring, this project recommends workout music based on heart rate.
